"""
Number of 1 Bits - LeetCode Problem 191

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has
(also known as the Hamming weight).

Note:

- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. -3.
