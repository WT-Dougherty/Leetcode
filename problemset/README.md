# New-Grad Coding Interview Problems (Python)

Fifteen problems increasing in difficulty covering arrays/strings, hashing, stacks/queues, linked lists, trees/graphs, backtracking, DP, binary search, heaps, union-find, and bit manipulation.

## How to run tests

From this folder, run a file directly (each file has a `_test()`):

```
python 01_max_subarray_sum_k.py
```

Or run the whole suite:

```
python run_all_tests.py
```

Progress:

- [x] 1. Max Subarray
- [x] 2. Longest Substring
- [ ] 3. Two Sum
- [ ] 4. Valid Parenthesis
- [ ] 5. Sliding Window
- [ ] 6. Reverse LinkedList
- [ ] 7. Binary Tree
- [ ] 8. LCA BST
- [ ] 9. Number of Islands
- [ ] 10. Permutations
- [ ] 11. Coin Change
- [ ] 12. Search Rotated
- [ ] 13. kth Largest
- [ ] 14. Union Find Count
- [ ] 15. Count Bits
